Create locations first, needed by actors.
I'd like to have maps, procedurally generated with all elements.
Generate heightmap through tectonic plate simulation
Simulate rainfall, rivers, erosion, plant growth...
Use generated map to place locations, connections, resources, possibilities...


language(id, name)

Should create actors before events

token_type(id, name)
["text", "actor", "location"]

event_type(id, name)
event_token(id, event_type_id, token, type_id)
Example ("speaker", 2) ("message", 1)

event_template(id, type_id, language_id, template)
Examples
speak, "%speaker% said: %message%"
whisper, "%speaker% whispered to you: %message%"
leave_location, "%actor% left %from_location% going towards %to_location%."
%% tokens are replaced with relevant data items


event(id, data, ingame_time, timestamp)
An event has json encoded data used to construct the text shown to the actor.

event_actor(id, event_id, actor_id)
An event is visible to a collection of actors.

Examples
{
	"template":"speak", 
	"speaker":2,
	"message":"Hello"
}
Receivers are everyone in the same location.

{
	"template":"whisper",
	"speaker":2,
	"message":"Hello"
}
Receivers are the actors chosen by the speaker.

{
	"template":"leave_location",
	"actor": 2,
	"from_location": 1,
	"to_location": 2
}
